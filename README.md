# Convolutional Neural Networks For Covid Patterns identification in chest X-rays
## ASU workshops

This repo will serve as companion for carrying out the workshops.

## Get Started

Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/hector6298/ASU_ConvNet_workshops
cd ASU_ConvNet_workshops
```

For simplicity Google colab will be our tool for running the code, as dependencies come installed out of the box. However if you want to run everything on your local computer you can refer to the Setup section.
