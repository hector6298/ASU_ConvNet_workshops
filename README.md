# Convolutional Neural Networks For Covid Patterns identification in chest X-rays
## ASU workshops

This repo will serve as companion for carrying out the workshops.

## Get Started

Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/hector6298/ASU_ConvNet_workshops
cd ASU_ConvNet_workshops
```

For simplicity Google colab will be our tool for running the code, as dependencies come installed out of the box. However if you want to run everything on your local computer you can refer to the Setup section. (work in progress...)

## Part 1: Input pipeline

How to feed your neural network for real world applications.

1) Please refer to DataPipeline.ipynb notebook on this repo. 
2) Upload to [google colab](colab.research.google.com)
3) Run the cells


## Part 2: Neural network definition and fitting

How to use out of the box keras convolutional neural netowrks for you image classification task.

1) Refer to CNNDefAndFit.ipynb notebook
2) Upload to [google colab](colab.research.google.com)
3) Run the cells
